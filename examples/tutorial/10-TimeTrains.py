Time Trains
===========
"""

# %% 
# As demonstrated in earlier posts in the tutorial, :mod:`pyquickbench` can be useful to measure the wall time of python functions. More often than not however, it can be useful to have a more precise idea of where CPU cycles are spent. This is the raison d'Ãªtre of :class:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain`. As shown in the following few lines, using a :class:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain` is extremely simple: simply call the :meth:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain.toc` method between snippets of code you want to time and :mod:`pyquickbench` takes care of the rest!

# Reductions make locations ill-defined, which is why :class:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain` is issuing a warning. Another good reason to disable location recording is that the corresponding call to :func:`python:inspect.stack` can be non-negligible (around 0.01s on a generic laptop computer).
# Displaying locations can be disabled like so:

TT = pyquickbench.TimeTrain(
    names_reduction = 'sum',

# %% 
# TimeTrains can also time calls to a function. The function :meth:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain.tictoc` will instrument a given function to record its execution time. The most straightforward is to use :meth:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain.tictoc` with a decorator syntax:

TT = pyquickbench.TimeTrain()

@TT.tictoc
def wait_a_bit():
    time.sleep(0.01)

@TT.tictoc
def wait_more():
    time.sleep(0.01)
    

wait_a_bit()
wait_more()

print(TT)

# %% 
# Using :meth:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain.tictoc` with a regular wrapping syntax might lead to surprizing results:
    
TT = pyquickbench.TimeTrain()
    
def wait_unrecorded():
    time.sleep(0.01)
    
wait_recorded = TT.tictoc(wait_unrecorded)

wait_unrecorded()
wait_recorded()

print(TT)

# %% 
# This behavior is to be expected because under the hood, :meth:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain.tictoc` uses the ``__name__`` attribute of the wrapped function. 
    
print(f'{wait_recorded.__name__ = }')

# %% 
# Overriding the ``__name__`` of the wrapped function gives the expected result:

TT = pyquickbench.TimeTrain()
    
def wait_unrecorded():
    time.sleep(0.01)
    
wait_recorded = TT.tictoc(wait_unrecorded)
wait_recorded.__name__ = 'wait_recorded'

wait_unrecorded()
wait_recorded()

print(TT)
# %% 
# More simply, you can set a custom name with the following syntax:

TT = pyquickbench.TimeTrain()
    
def wait_unrecorded():
    time.sleep(0.01)
    
wait_recorded = TT.tictoc(wait_unrecorded, name = "my_custom_name")

wait_unrecorded()
wait_recorded()

print(TT)

# %% 
# By default, a :class:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain` will not show timings occuring in between decorated function. This behavior can be overriden setting the ``ignore_names`` argument to an empty iterator:

TT = pyquickbench.TimeTrain(ignore_names = [])
    
def wait_unrecorded():
    time.sleep(0.01)
    
@TT.tictoc
def wait_recorded():
    time.sleep(0.02)

wait_unrecorded()
wait_recorded()

print(TT)

# Let's revisit the benchmark in :ref:`sphx_glr__build_auto_examples_tutorial_09-Vector_output.py` and measure the execution time of different parts of the function ``uniform_quantiles`` using :class:`pyquickbench.TimeTrain`.

# This function can be divided up into three main parts:
# 
# * A random sampling phase, where data is generated. This part is expected to scale as :math:`\mathcal{O}(n)`.
# * A sorting phase where the random vector is sorted in-place. This part is expected to scale as :math:`\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))`, and thus be dominant for large :math:`n`.
# * A last phase where estimated quantiles are built and returned. This phase is expected to scale as :math:`\mathcal{O}(1)` and be negligible for large :math:`n`.
